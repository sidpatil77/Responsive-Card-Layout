        <h3 class="card-title">Bugatti Chiron Super Sport
        </h3>
        <p class="card-description">The world’s fastest production car. Yep, the go-faster Super Sport is based on the Bugatti Chiron that Andy Wallace piloted to 304.773mph back in 2019, and features an 8.0-litre quad-turbo V16 producing an extra 100bhp over the standard Chiron. All in, that’s 1,578bhp at your disposal. In fact, there’s just one difference to the Chiron which smashed the 300mph barrier – the top speed has been limited to a mere 273mph</p>

        <h3 class="card-title">Rimac Nevera</h3>
        <p class="card-description">The Nevera is astonishingly fast. Fast in a way that’s tricky to put into words, either while you’re sitting in it trying to process what the hell is happening to your mind, body and soul when you nail the throttle, or a few days later writing about it,” wrote Jason Barlow when he got the call to test drive the Rimac Nevera in Croatia last year. So allow us to hit you with some numbers instead: courtesy of a 120kWh battery, four motors driving each wheel individually, and a power output equivalent to 1,914bhp and 1,740lb ft of torque, Mate Rimac’s hypercar is capable of 0-60mph in 1.85 seconds, 100mph in 4.3secs, and 186mph in 9.3secs – on to a 258mph max.</p>

        <h3 class="card-title">Lamborghini Sián</h3>
        <p class="card-description">With a name derived from the Bolognese dialect for lightning bolt, it’s no surprise that electrification is the Sián’s talking point, too. It features a tuned version of the Aventador SVJ’s 6.5-litre, naturally aspirated V12, with another 34bhp of electrical oomph (courtesy of lithium-ion supercapacitors) added for a total of 808bhp. And while that electroboost may not sound a whole lot in the grand scheme of things, it helps to smooth out the savage gearshifts that have plagued Lambos since the Aventador.</p>

      <div class="card-content">
        <h3 class="card-title">Ferrari 812 Competizione</h3>
        <p class="card-description">The 812 features a naturally aspirated V12 – no electric gubbins or turbos in sight – but it’s also quite possibly the last we’ll ever see. We’re not crying, you are. It’s essentially a go-faster, er, Superfast, with power upped to 819bhp and torque to 513lb ft. Add in much weight saving and aero work and the results are predictably ballistic. If, as suspected, it is Ferrari’s last bastion of non-hybrid nat-asp, it’s not a bad way to go out.</p>
